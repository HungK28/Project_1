The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is an SBA-backed loan program that helped businesses keep their workforce employed during the COVID-19 crisis.  The PPP was implemented in April 2020 to provide relief to small businesses that were impacted by the coronavirus by providing 2.5 months of a company's average payroll that would be 100% forgivable if funds were used to retain employees. In January 2021, a second round of relief (PPS) was offered with stricter criteria including proof of a
25% revenue reduction in at least one quarter of 2020 compared to the prior year.

Since the loans were funded through the SBA, the loan information has been made publicly available. Our data set includes the all the PPP loans that were funded in California for both PPP and PPS. In this project, we tried to analyze the publicly available PPP loan-disbursement data for California and get a birds-eye view of the program. The analysis sheds light on the small businesses in California that got access to these disbursed loans to counteract the economic impact of the pandemic.  To be specific, we tried to answer the following questions:

1.	What is the total count and total amount of loans disbursed? 
    
    Total Amount of Loans ($B): $103B. Total Loan Count: 1.3 Million

2.	What is the industry-wide distribution of the loans? Which industries got more loans?

The dataset included NAICS code for each small business that got a loan. The North American Industry Classification System or NAICS is a classification of business establishments by type of economic activity (process of production). It is used by government and business in Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America. From the NAICS codes we could come up with the industry-wide loan distribution. Service industries got more loans compared to manufacturing.

3.	Which banks provided most of the loans?

The following bar diagram shows that the traditional big banks were the biggest lenders in this case too.

4.	What is the relationship between size of the loan and number of employees on the payroll?

Positive strong correlation (=0.72) between size of the loan and number of employees on the payroll. This can suggest that the size of the loan is determined on the employee count.

5.	What is the geographical distribution of the loans made? Which county got the most loan?
    Analysis Breakdown
    
● Grouped data set by counties

● Broke out loans by PPP and PPS

● Compared total loan amounts by counties 

● Compared total loan amounts per the counties population

Results

● Total loan amounts for both PPP and PPS seemed consistent with population size.

● Loan amounts per capita showed more concentration in counties surrounding the bay area.

● More rural counties seemed to have lower loan amounts per capita.

7.	Did business-owners of a particular race/ethnicity get more loans? If yes, is it statistically significant?
